Follow all industry coding best practices.
Functions do one thing.
Files do one thing.
Every function has a docstring.
Every file has a docstring.
Every variable name describes what it does.
It should be obvious how it works.
I should not have to scroll my screen to read a function, like <10 loc per function.
A bunch of related functions should probably go in a class.
Use common sense when coding.
No more than 79 chars per line.
Leave nothing undocumented.
Leave no code untested.
Put test result output in its own markdown file.
Don't make folders in the project, create a project structure python codegen.
Project as it is might not fit this guide, fix it.
Remove duplicate code from this repo.
Make everything well and good and proper, people have to read this stuff.
All usual standard files (varies from language to language) - README.md, LICENCE.md, setup.py, requirements.txt, run.sh, run.bat, setup.sh, setup.bat

* Follow all industry coding best practices.
* Functions do one thing.
* Files do one thing.
* Every function has a docstring.
* Every file has a docstring.
* Every variable name describes what it does.
* It should be obvious how it works.
* I should not have to scroll my screen to read a function, like <10 loc per function.
* A bunch of related functions should probably go in a class.
* Use common sense when coding.
* No more than 79 chars per line.
* Leave nothing undocumented.
* Leave no code untested.
* Put test result output in its own markdown file.
* Don't make folders in the project, create a project structure python codegen. Makes it easy to paste it into a AI chatbot.
* Project as it is might not fit this guide, fix it.
* Remove duplicate code from this repo.
* Make everything well and good and proper, people have to read this stuff.
* All usual standard files (varies from language to language) - README.md, LICENCE.md, setup.py, requirements.txt, run.sh, run.bat, setup.sh, setup.bat
* This is a not for profit research project intended for personal use - But I try to put a MIT licence on it so you can do what you wish.
* Innovate as much as possible.
* Pave the way for future features, plugin systems?
* Programmers are egotistical because they are annoyed with fixing other peoples poorly written code.
* Things like PEP8 are a great thing, lets have more of that.
* Logging is a brilliant thing, put it everywhere. I also like progress bars and things on CLI apps.

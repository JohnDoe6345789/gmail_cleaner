# Agent Instructions

This repository uses `STYLE.md` as the source of truth for coding conventions. When modifying or adding code:

1. Review `STYLE.md` and follow its guidance on structure, documentation, testing, and project layout.
2. Keep pull request descriptions concise, highlighting noteworthy behavioral or documentation updates.
3. Capture command output for any tests you run so it can be referenced in review discussions.
4. Preserve the repository's minimal directory structure unless a new folder is clearly justified.
5. When editing documentation-only files, ensure phrasing is clear, direct, and free of redundancy.

These instructions apply to all files in this repository unless superseded by a more specific nested `AGENTS.md`.
